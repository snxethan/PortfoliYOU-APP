## Critical Blockers

These issues should prevent shipping:

- [ ] Cannot sign in with Google
- [ ] Cannot sign out
- [ ] Protected routes accessible when signed out
- [ ] App crashes on launch
- [ ] OAuth popup blocked/doesn't work

## High Priority Issues

These should be fixed before release:

- [ ] Session doesn't persist after app restart
- [ ] Navigation breaks
- [ ] External links open in Electron window
- [ ] Console errors on normal operation

## Low Priority Issues

These can be addressed in future updates:

- [ ] UI/styling inconsistencies
- [ ] Missing analytics tracking
- [ ] Email verification not enforced
- [ ] Missing Microsoft login option
